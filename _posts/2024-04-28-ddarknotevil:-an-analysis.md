## ddarknotevil: an analysis

**Targeted countries:** 43, globally
**Targeted industries:** Widely varied

ddarknotevil first emerged in August 2023 and is a frequent user of underground forums. The account has a high reputation for leaking database dumps but has more recently pivoted to selling remote acesss for profit. Ddarknotevil appears to target networks with vulnerable web-applications and FTP servers to extract data.

In 2023, ddarknotevil released at least 80 stolen databases on public underground forums for free download or a small number of forum currency. The industries of victims are incredibly varied and sold access is typically provided via compromised FTP and web-shells; it is likely that they have a collection of vulnerabilties that they look to exploit rather than targeting specific companies. Their account has targeted organisations within over 43 different countries since August last year.

Ddarknotevil started posting on closed access forums at the start of 2024, moving to privately selling obtained access for cash. Publicly available forums are typically used for dumps rather than high-priced data and access. There is a noticable decrease in the number of posts by ddarknotevil in this year compared to 2023, which could suggest that they are more recently focusing on closed forum access brokerage rather than easy wins. 

### Notable Breaches

ddarknotevil has an estimated criminal net worth of 4,000 ~ 6,000 USD.

### Timezone Analysis
