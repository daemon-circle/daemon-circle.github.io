## ddarknotevil: an analysis

**Targeted countries:** 43, globally | **Targeted industries:** Widely varied

ddarknotevil first emerged in August 2023 and is a frequent user of underground forums. The account has a high reputation for leaking database dumps but has more recently pivoted to selling remote access for profit. ddarknotevil appears to target networks with vulnerable web-applications and FTP servers to extract data.

In 2023, ddarknotevil released at least 80 stolen databases on public underground forums for free download or a small number of forum currency. The industries of victims are incredibly varied and sold access is typically provided via compromised FTP and web-shells; it is likely that they target organisations opportunistically rather than targeting specific companies. Their account has targeted organisations within over 43 different countries since August last year.

ddarknotevil became active on closed access forums at the start of 2024. Publicly available forums are typically used for dumps rather than high-priced data and access. In comparison, closed forum users are more willing to trade access without the (full) public eye. Since the start of this year, ddarknotevil began listing accesses and data for private sale with prices between 100s of USD to a few thousand. There is a noticeable decrease in the number of posts by the account compared to 2023, which could suggest that they are more recently focusing on closed forum access brokerage rather than easy wins for rep.

### Notable Breaches

ddarknotevil has an estimated criminal net worth of 4,000 ~ 6,000 USD.

*Post of St Jude Laboratories (With personal info redacted).*

- 60GB of patient data stolen from St Jude Laboratories sold for 3,500 USD (March 2024).
- Web-shell access to Valenica University Polytechnic for 500 USD (February 2024).
- Web-shell access to an unnamed Spanish 'Political Union' website for 300 USD (February 2024).
- 136GB of data stolen from Indonesian Ministry of Economic Affairs, dumped for free (February 2024).

In March 2024 the user claimed to have stolen data from authentication service Okta however several sources have disputed that the data was edited from an unrelated IntelBroker breach. The original forum post has been deleted.

### Assessment

ddarknotevil is a prolific user of underground forums and has a proven history of listing stolen company data and access. If they do continue to operate, it is highly likely that the majority of databases and accesses provided will be gained via FTP and web-application vulnerabilities. There is currently no evidence to suggest that ddarknotevil has or will change their intrusion techniques. The user last posted in early April 2024 and it remains to be seen if they will continue to target vulnerable companies and government organisations for monetary gain.
